# book_tracker_proposal

The book tracker app will allow users to track the books they have read and provide their own ratings. Posts will include title, author, date finished, an uploaded cover image, a rating, and the user's thoughts. Users will be able to edit and delete their own posts, but will only be able to view posts from other users. The dashboard will feature a list of 5 books read by other users, selected at random. Users can shuffle the books for new options by clicking the "Shuffle books" button. Login and registration is required.
